Welcom to my github!

I love programming. I plan to one day mix this passion with my career by becoming a software engineer. 

So far I am great at HTML, CSS, javascript, and React. 

I'm looking forward to particpating in some open source projects. 

I'm putting more of a focus on documentation on my projects going forward. 

Please reach out for anything and everything. I'd love to collaborate.
